![screenshot 1](graphics/app_screen.png)

## Application Description

This project is a streamlit application for simulating population evolution taking into account speciation. In the application, you can change various parameters, such as:

- Number of generations
- Mutation probability
- Maximum number of offspring

and observe how these parameters affect the development of the population.

## Running the Program

The required libraries can be installed them using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.

To launch the program, go to the source directory and run ```streamlit run app.py```.
